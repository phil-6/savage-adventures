    <h2>What Is Canyoning?</h2>
    <p>Canyoning is defined as <em>"the activity of following a river bed through a gorge. This often includes
      climbing, swimming, abseiling and scrambling depending upon the environment".</em></p>
    <p>Our experienced instructors will take you down one of our stunning Welsh rivers and over the course of about
      4 hours you’ll find yourself traversing waterfalls, swimming down rapids and jumping into deep plunge
      pools!</p>
    <p>All of our adventures are <em>“challenge by choice”</em>, we want to help you step out of your comfort zone
      and get the adrenaline pumping, but we know that everyone's comfort zones are different. The day is all
      about you, and you can do as much or as little as you want to.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info-section">
    <h2>Where is it?</h2>
    <p>Our canyoning adventures take place in the <a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/waterfall-country">Waterfall
      Country</a> area of the Brecon Beacons. In order to preserve the natural beauty of the National Park
      activities are limited to the Afon Mellte and the Sychryd rivers which are both near Pontneddfechan. We’ll
      confirm the exact meeting point for the day when you book.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info-section">
    <h2>Who's it best for?</h2>
    <p>Canyoning is an adventurous activity which involves several hours of walking over loose and slippery terrain
      as such we recommend at least a moderate level of fitness. The actual swimming is minimal so don’t worry if
      you can’t swim at all, our kit will keep you afloat and our guides will keep you safe.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info-section">
    <h2>What we’ll provide?</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Wetsuit</strong> to keep you warm.</li>
      <li><strong>Buoyancy Aid</strong> to keep you afloat.</li>
      <li><strong>Helmet</strong> to keep your head safe.</li>
      <li><strong>Attractive* Guide</strong> to help you have a fun and safe day out.</li>
      <li><strong>Footage</strong> to remember your adventure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Attractiveness is subjective, we can’t promise you’ll find your guide attractive</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info-section">
    <h2>What do you need to bring?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shoes</strong> to get wet. (Old trainers are best)</li>
      <li><strong>Shorts</strong> to go over your wetsuit.</li>
      <li><strong>Swim gear</strong> to go under your wetsuit.<sup>*</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Towel and warm clothes</strong> for after.</li>
      <li><strong>Lunch</strong> (although we can recommend a good couple of great local pubs nearby)</li>
      <li><strong>Yourselves.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><sup>*</sup>You are more than welcome to bring extra clothing to wear underneath your wetsuit but we can’t
      allow anything cotton to get wet as this will actually just make you colder. Synthetic leggings, lycra
      shorts and tops or thin neoprene rash vests will all work well. <strong><em>Don’t worry if you don’t have
        this, all our wetsuits are thick winter suits and we’ll be moving lots so you’ll stay plenty warm.</em></strong>

    <h2>Is there anything else?</h2>
    <p>We are at the mercy of mother nature, and as such, occasionally we have to make the call to cancel our
      activities due to the weather. If this does happen we will always “rain check” and postpone for another
      day. </p>
    <p>The car park we meet in is quite small, and our environment is fragile so please endeavour to share lifts
      wherever possible</p>
