Savage Adventures was created in early 2015, With the goal of inspiring people to explore and enjoy the natural world, we achieve this by helping you to discover your primal side though adventures both extreme and tame that are guaranteed to make memories that will last a lifetime!

Our adventures are amazing experiences in unique locations across South Wales, we tailor each activity to suit your requirements - whether you're a seasoned adventurer or just wanting to dip your toes in the water

All of our adventures are "Challenge by Choice", we want to help you find the edge of your comfort zone but you're
always going to have to be the one who takes the step past that limit. Our instructors are there to facilitate that, and to make sure you're completely safe when you do. We tailor all of our adventures to the group, regardless of whether you're seeking the next level of thrills or just to break out of the ordinary.
