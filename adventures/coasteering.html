        <h2>What Is Coasteering?</h2>
        <p>The definition of Coasteering is <em>“is a physical activity that encompasses movement along the intertidal zone of a rocky coastline on foot or by swimming, without the aid of boats, surf boards or other craft.”</em> Coasteering was first commercialised just around the corner on the Welsh Coast in Pembrokeshire by our friends at <a href="https://www.tyf.com/pages/coasteering">TYF</a>.</p>
        <p>On one of these adventures, over about 4 hours, you’ll find yourself scrambling up cliffs, swimming across bays, exploring caves and jumping from land to sea.</p>
        <p>All of our adventures are <em>“challenge by choice”</em>, we want to help you step out of your comfort zone
            and get the adrenaline pumping, but we know that everyone's comfort zones are different. The day is all
            about you, and you can do as much or as little as you want to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Where is it?</h2>
        <p>While Pembrokeshire has the claim to being the home of coasteering it wasn’t long before it spread to the Gower, where we run our adventures. Most of our coasteering takes place around the Rhossili area.</p>
        <p>The Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in the world, this is the same tide that affects the Gower coastline. While the tidal range at Rhossili isn’t quite as large as Bristol (~15m) it’s pretty close (~12m) this means that we are tied to the tides for when we can run our activities</p>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Who's it best for?</h2>
        <p>Coasteering is an adventurous physical activity which involves several hours of scrabling over uneven and often slippery sea cliffs and swimming in the open ocean as such we recommend at least a moderate level of fitness and basic swimming ability. The actual swimming is minimal so don’t worry if you’re not a strong swimming, our kit will keep you afloat and our guides will keep you safe</p>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>What do you need to bring?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shoes</strong> to get wet. (Old trainers are best)</li>
            <li><strong>Shorts</strong> to go over your wetsuit.</li>
            <li><strong>Swim gear</strong> to go under your wetsuit.<sup>*</sup></li>
            <li><strong>Towel and warm clothes</strong> for after.</li>
            <li><strong>Lunch</strong> (although we can recommend a good couple of great local pubs nearby)</li>
            <li><strong>Yourselves.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><sup>*</sup>You are more than welcome to bring extra clothing to wear underneath your wetsuit but we can’t
            allow anything cotton to get wet as this will actually just make you colder. Synthetic leggings, lycra
            shorts and tops or thin neoprene rash vests will all work well. <strong><em>Don’t worry if you don’t have
                this, all our wetsuits are thick winter suits and we’ll be moving lots so you’ll stay plenty warm.</em></strong>

        <h2>Is there anything else?</h2>
        <p>We are at the mercy of mother nature, and as such, occasionally we have to make the call to cancel our
            activities due to the weather. If this does happen we will always “rain check” and postpone for another
            day. </p>
